Smartthings/Hubitat Device Handlers for Rheem Econet
Everything here is based on the work of the following users on the SmartThings forums:

Justin Huff
fsrt
Brian Spranger

and I'm sure others. I've renamed the app and DH under my namespace to avoid confusion, not in an attempt to steal the credit from those above, who did the bulk of the work here.

Install: 

Copy/paste the Device Handler into your Smart Things IDE, then publish.
Copy/paste the Smart App into your Smart Things IDE, then add a copy of the Smart App to your installation via your phone.


TODO:

Modify the connect app so that it discovers thermostats, water heaters, and tankless water heaters. Right now you have to install a version of the app for both water heaters, and thermostats.
